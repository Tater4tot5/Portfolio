# Portfolio Inspiration

## Portfolios I like:

###First and foremost:

(http://creativeda.sh/ "Creative Dash") This is a design studio that explains their process right on the home page, then they have an easy-to-find call to action button to view "case studies" which leads you to their work.

(http://seanhalpin.io/ "Sean Halpin") I love the easy-to-navigate layout and I also like how he displays his work in an easy-to-read way and incorporates his illustration, even though he is marketing himself as a web designer, which is what I would like to accomplish with my portfolio.

(http://owltastic.com/ "Meagan Fisher") Does a great job branding herself right on the homepage of her portfolio with iconic log, info on what she's written lately, case studies, etc. Really love her layout.

(http://charlottetang.com/ "Charlotte Tang") easy-to-navigate, easy to tell the kind of work she is showcasing, the challenges, and what she contributed to each project

(https://www.studioairport.nl/ "studioairport") Clean, modern, not overdone or trying to hard. I like the order and flow of how they present the agency, then the work, then the people, then the studio, blog, client feedback, contact info, etc.

###Then there's these runner-ups:

(https://bert.house/en/ "bert") I like the clean, simple, work presented as case studies on single pages

(http://uxaviator.com/ "uxaviator") I like how Arshad showcases his work visually on his homepage and explains it all concisely

(http://mrcthms.com/ "mrcthms") I like how Marc incorporates illustration and color into his portfolio. The CSS animation is cool too.

(http://melaniedaveid.com/ "Melanie DaVeid") Melanie's portfolio only has 3 projects, but she goes in depth to explain them and she does so with animation and a layout that is really intriguing.

(http://smartgc.com.ar/english.php "Smart") Interesting way of displaying their projects (rather than hidden behind one image, they display everything horizontally), but they don't do a great job detailing challenges of the projects


## Portfolios I don't like:

(http://www.nicholasslater.co/ "Nick Slater") I love Nick Slater's work, but he doesn't explain any of his work in his portfolio and it's difficult to even find out who the work is done for or who his clients are, let alone define the problem and his process for each design.

(http://schubox.com/ "Kevin Schumaker") He does a great job explaining each project and his process, but the layout for each project is different and you have to search for the information to piece together a story. Plus his stories about the project are too flowery and wordy and I think it wouldn't work as well for a junior designer to have this much going on on each project page bc people won't be studying our portfolios for as long as they might a more established designer/art director like Kevin.

(http://blueflavor.com/people/nick-finck/ "Nick Finck") This was another site given as an example of a good way to showcase ux work in one of our readings. This may be true, but it feels like a lot of words and the layout, typography, and pictures and icons give it a really home-made, outdated feel

(http://www.giselejaquenod.com.ar/ "Gisele Jaquenod") Too cutesy, you have to click to "enter" and there's waaaayyyy too much going on on the landing page so you don't even see how great her actual work is
